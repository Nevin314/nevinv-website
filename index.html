    <h1> Hi, I'm Nevin! </h2>

    <h2>About me: </h1>
    <p> Hello, I'm Nevin. This is my personal website, where I'll be detailing what I'm working on, what I've learned, and anything
        else related to my technical experiences and skills. After reading through this website, you should have a better grasp of 
        my knowledge and what I can contribute as a software engineer. <br> <br> Currently, I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Texas A&M. I've been interested in Computer Science since middle school, when I 
        began my journey by writing simple scripts and basic games in my free time. Since then, I've learned a lot about Computer 
        Science - from the theoretical side to the more hands-on world of hardware. I've taken classes on topics like data structures
        and algorithms, and topics like hardware architecture, down to the CPU design. I learned a lot from these classes, and plan 
        on taking many more. Outside of school,
        I've also gained a lot of real world experiences. Last summer, I interned at Fidelity Investments as a Fullstack Software 
        Engineer, where I learned a lot of things about writing industry standard code, collaborating with other software engineers, 
        and how to use a lot of new industry tools. This was a great experience for me, and took me one step closer to becoming a full-on
        software engineer. Even apart from work experience, I've worked on several <a href="projects.html">personal projects</a> in my
        free time, ranging from CLI tools to websites (like this one here). 
        <br> More recently, I've become interested in the algorithmic side of computer science more. I have started solving problems 
        on <a href="https://codeforces.com">codeforces</a>, a competitive programming website. It's been challenging, but I've
        learned a lot and grown to appreciate computer science a lot more - particularly the deep connection it has to math and the 
        powerful ability to solve complex problems with massive inputs in just milliseconds. 
        <br> In the future, I hope to utilize my problem-solving skills and passion for low-level programming in my job. If you're

        was inspired by apple, and takes a more minimalistic approach.
